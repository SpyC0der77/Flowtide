# Using Widgets

Flowtide's new widget approach is a modular system for adding, removing, and organizing your own widgets. This allows you to customize your Flowtide experience to your liking.

## How to use

> Make sure you're on the latest version of Flowtide. You also need to have the 'Widgets' mode enabled.

To add a widget, click on the `+` button in the top right corner of the Flowtide window. This will open a dialog box where you can select the widget you want to add.

## Options

After you add a widget, you can add it by hovering over the widget and clicking the X icon. This will remove the widget. You can also drag and drop the widget to change its position.

Widgets will also tune to your selected theme.
